# 📌 Java & Spring Interview Questions

## 1. What is Reflection in Java? Why is it runtime? How does DI use it?

**Reflection in Java** is a **runtime mechanism** that allows inspection and modification of classes, methods, and fields dynamically — even without knowing them at compile time.

Frameworks like Spring use reflection for **Dependency Injection**, reading annotations, creating objects, and invoking methods dynamically (without `new` keyword), making the application loosely coupled and configurable.
